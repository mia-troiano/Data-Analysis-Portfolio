# **Data Analysis Portfolio**  

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio!  

**I am Mia Troiano**, a licensed Physical Therapist (DPT) transitioning into **data analytics**. I leverage my **clinical expertise**, **analytical skills**, and **strong communication abilities** to translate complex data into actionable insights that drive informed decisions and meaningful outcomes.

This repository showcases a range of projects using various data analysis tools and methods, including:  

- **Excel:** Data cleaning, visualization, Power Query, and advanced spreadsheet functions.  
- **SQL:** Database querying, manipulation, and reporting for meaningful insights.  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and business intelligence reporting (DAX, data modeling).  

Each project demonstrates practical applications of these tools to solve real-world problems and uncover insights from data.  

I hold certifications in:  
- **Excel for Data Analysis (IBM)**
